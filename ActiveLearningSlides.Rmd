# Hands-on with technology *during* class.


# Let's try it


### Work with a partner to access this link and/or QR code (they're the same)

<br>

### Link: <https://bit.ly/2NwXC0g> 

(Note: that's a zero near the end...)

<br> 

### QR code:

# Success!

Here's what we did:

1. identify any target URL that we want the audience to have:
    - <https://mdbeckman.github.io/2018-PSU-Active-Learning-Panel/ActiveLearningSlides.html#(3)>
    - the full URL is too complicated...
2. generate QR code for that URL (e.g. <https://www.qr-code-generator.com/>)
3. use free service to generate shorter link to that URL (e.g. <https://bitly.com/>)
4. put it on the screen!


Alternatively: you could post the link in Canvas, but that assumes they already have the Canvas app if you expect some to use Smartphones.  


# Hands-on with technology *during* class

- Large class (225 students): *redeem the smartphone*
    - QR codes they can scan from their seat
    - shortened URL's
    - Google Forms for data entry + live analysis
    - PollEverywhere live texting inbox for Q&A
    - Web applets that illustrate statistics concepts
        - <http://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/>

- Small class (30 students): *web-based tools w/ laptops*
    - establish pairs or small groups 
    - chromebook supplement (if needed?)
    - web-based platform for statistical programming
