# Link to resources




# You found them!

Here's what I did:

1. identify target URL that I want my audience to have
2. generate QR code for that URL ()
3. use bit.ly to generate short link to that URL ()
4. put it on the screen!

Alternatively: you could post the link in Canvas, but that assumes they already have the Canvas app if you expect some to use Smartphones.
